(BOX MODEL)

margin

padding

content -> h1 i.e.

padding

margin

/* 
(PERCENTAGES NO PIXELS)

Body has 100% by default, so establish its 
width and height always with percentages.
Never pixels
Percentages is refering always
to his parent element */

/* 
(MARGIN AUTO 0)
When you have specified a width on the object that 
you have applied margin: 0 auto to, the object 
will sit centrally within it's parent container.

*/

/* 
(box-sizing: border-box;)

Content, padding, and border will not be more
than the width and heigth, see here:

*/

/* 
(EM)

2 scenarios:

em is always looking at the font-size of his parent
by default font-size is 16px = 1 em

however, when establishing padding, border or margin
in ems, is looking at its own font-size, which can 
be declared inside as 2em, so p,b and m wont be
looking at his parent but to his own font-size
*/

/* 
(REM -> root em)

only 1 scenario

rem is always looking at the font-size of the root
recommended for buttons, see here:
